    <h1>Register for MAASL</h1>

        <p class="content">
        <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">Please read the following important information before registering.</span><br /><br />
        
        <strong>Session Information</strong><br /><br />
        
        <!-- Spring 2014 starts Saturday, March 8th.  Online registration is open through <strong>Feburary 9th</strong>.<br /><br /> -->
        The Fall 2014 season starts the first week of September.<br /><br />

        Please register early!  Teams are formed on a first-come, first served basis.  MAASL attempts to honor requests from players 
        wishing to be paired on the same team, but we are unable to guarantee that all such requests are granted.<br /><br />
        
        <strong>Fees</strong><br /><br />
        
        Registration fees are <strong>$75.00</strong> for Menlo Park residents, <strong>$85.00</strong> for non-residents, and <strong>$25.00</strong> 
        for MAASL jerseys.  <em>All players must wear official MAASL jerseys during games</em>.  Before registering, please make sure to familiarize 
        yourself with our refund policy toward the bottom of this page.<br /><br />
        
        <!-- <strong>Group Registrations</strong><br /><br />
        
        If you want to play with one or two of your friends, MAASL will accommodate requests of up to 3 players wishing 
        to be placed on the same team.  Groups larger than 3 will be split arbitrarily.  Please clearly indicate somewhere 
        on your application the names of the women you want to play with.<br /><br /> -->
        
        <strong>Uniforms</strong><br /><br />
        
        All players, except goalies are required to wear official MAASL jerseys during games (jerseys can be purchased as part of the online 
        registration process).  Your team coordinator will supply you with a jersey in the size you indicated during registration at the beginning of the 
        season.  If you have questions about MAASL jerseys, please contact our uniforms and equipment manager Lisa Collins (lizacollins at yahoo.com).  
        Shin guards are required and must be covered by soccer socks.  Shorts and socks may be of any color.  Players must not use equipment or wear 
        anything that is dangerous to herself or another player (including any kind of jewelry).  Leg braces must be covered.

        <strong>Registration Instructions</strong><br /><br />
        
        <!-- <span style="color:red; font-weight:bold;">Registration for Spring 2013 is closed.  Online form for Fall 2013 coming soon.</span><br /><br /> -->
        
		Please use our <a href="https://maasl.wufoo.com/forms/sa1h5lh1y3t9ha/"><strong>online form</strong></a> to register and pay for the 
        Fall 2014 season.  All payments are collected via <a href="https://www.paypal.com/">PayPal</a>.  You don't need to have a PayPal 
        account in order to pay via PayPal, but you may want to set one up to make the registration process easier.  You will receive an 
        automated e-mail confirmation after you register; if you don't receive confirmation within a day or two, you must contact us to verify

        <strong>Refund Policy</strong><br /><br />
        
        Full refunds are granted <em>only if you notify us within 3 weeks of the start of the 
        season</em>.  This period of time gives the board a chance to replace you with someone from the waiting list.  Due to the 
        fact that MAASL is a non-profit league with fixed expenses each season, we are not in a position to offer refunds if 
        you notify us any later than 3 weeks from the season start date.  This includes partial refunds and/or credits for 
        the following season.  Thank you for your understanding.<br /><br />
