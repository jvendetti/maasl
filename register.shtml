        <strong>Wait List</strong><br /><br />
		Players who register and pay after the start of the season will be placed on a wait list. The Registrar will manage the wait list and 
		place those players on teams as soon as possible. If we are unable to place you on a team, we will notify you within two weeks and issue a 
		complete refund of fees.<br /><br />



        <strong>Refund Policy</strong><br /><br />
        Full refunds are granted <em>only if you notify us within 3 weeks of the start of the 
        season</em>.  This period of time gives the board a chance to replace you with someone from the waiting list.  Due to the 
        fact that MAASL is a non-profit league with fixed expenses each season, we are not in a position to offer refunds if 
        you notify us any later than 3 weeks from the season start date.  This includes partial refunds and/or credits for 
        the following season.  Thank you for your understanding.<br /><br />
        
        <strong>Conditions of League Play</strong><br /><br />
        In consideration of my being permitted to participate in the Menlo-Atherton Adult Soccer, Inc. program referred to in this Application for recreational benefits to myself, I hereby for myself, my heirs, executors, and administrators, waive and release any and all claims for damages I may have against Menlo Atherton Adult Soccer, Inc., the individual members thereof, and all the officers, agents, and employees, and hold the corporation and all such persons free and harmless to any loss, damage, liability, injury, cost or expense that may be suffered by me while participating in or practicing for soccer and all related games, tournaments and other activities. 

        Player agrees by registering that she is aware of the signs of a concussion:
        Headache or “pressure” in the head  Double or blurry vision
        Nausea or vomiting  Balance problems or dizziness
        Sensitivity to light    Sensitivity to noise
        Feeling sluggish, hazy, foggy, or groggy    Concentration or memory problems
        Confusion   Just “not feeling right” or “feeling down”.

        The onset of any of these signs could be at the time of the head injury, but they can also occur in subsequent weeks. A player who sustains a head injury during a game should not return to play until a concussion can be ruled out. Should a player suffer a concussion, she agrees to get clearance by a medical professional before resuming on-field soccer participation with MAASL.

        I certify and agree that as long as I am a participant in the Menlo-Atherton Adult Soccer, Inc. program, I will abide by its rules, regulations and conditions as prescribed by the Corporation's Board of Directors and the league coaches and referees.

        <strong>***Weekly email reminders will be sent to each player. Players must reply back, either with a yes or no so team coordinators know how many women will be participating in weekly games.  Failure to reply back could result in being dropped from team.***</strong><br/><br/>
